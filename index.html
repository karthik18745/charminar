                <p>Charminar, an iconic monument located in the heart of Hyderabad, was built in 1591 by Muhammad Quli Qutb Shah, the 5th ruler of the Qutb Shahi dynasty. It was constructed to commemorate the founding of Hyderabad and as a symbol of the eradication of a plague that had devastated the city. The Charminar stands at the intersection of the historical trade routes that connected the Golconda Kingdom to other regions, making it a significant cultural and commercial hub during its time. The structure is renowned for its Indo-Islamic architecture, with each of its four grand arches facing the cardinal directions and topped with four soaring minarets.</p>
